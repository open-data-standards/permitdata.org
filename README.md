# BLDS Data Specification

NOTE - this data standard is not being actively maintained, and is provided for informational purposes to those interested in building permit standards.

The BLDS (pronounced "Builds") data standard is a collaborative effort by civic technology companies, governments and other interested parties to create a shared data specification for building and construction permit data. This is part of a much broader effort to create shared standards for the open data being released by state, county and municipal governments across the country.
